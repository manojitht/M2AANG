#
# ### **Requirements:**
#
# #### **1. Product Management:**
# - Create a base class `Product` with attributes:
#   - `product_id` (Unique ID for each product)
#   - `name`
#   - `price`
#   - `quantity_in_stock`
# - Include methods to:
#   - Display product details.
#   - Check product availability.
#
# - Create two subclasses:
#   - **Electronics**: Add attributes like `brand` and `warranty` (in years).
#   - **Clothing**: Add attributes like `size` and `material`.
#

#
# #### **2. Shopping Cart:**
# - Create a `ShoppingCart` class with:
#   - A dictionary or list to store products and their quantities.
#   - Methods to:
#     - Add a product to the cart (check availability).
#     - Remove a product from the cart.
#     - View all items in the cart.
#     - Calculate the total price of items in the cart.
#     - Apply a **10% discount** if the total price exceeds a threshold (e.g., $500).
#
# ---
#
# #### **3. Order Processing:**
# - Create an `Order` class to:
#   - Store cart items, total price, and an order ID.
#   - Process the order by:
#     - Deducting the purchased quantities from the stock.
#     - Generating a receipt with order details.
#

#
# #### **4. Display and Interaction:**
# - Allow users to:
#   - View available products.
#   - Add/remove items to/from the shopping cart.
#   - View cart details and checkout.
#
