# 541. Reverse String II
# Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

# If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
# Output: "bacdfeg"

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
# Output: "bacd"

## My Solution (pattern: similar two pointer)
class Solution:
    def reverseStr(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        result = []
        for i in range(0, len(s), 2 * k):
            result.append(s[i:i + k][::-1])
            result.append(s[i + k:i + 2 * k])
        return ''.join(result)
