# Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

# Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

# All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
# Output: true

# Explanation:
# The strings s and t can be made identical by:

# Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
# Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "f11", t = "b23"
# Output: false

# Explanation:
# The strings s and t can not be made identical as '1' needs to be mapped to both '2' and '3'.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
# Output: true

                return False
                
            hashtable_ST[char_s] = char_t
